# Lab 1
## Command 1 (cd)
**No argument**
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
The working directory was on the root directory /home. When we put in no argument, the cd command 
does not change the current directory. This is not an error as the computer needs to know what
directory to change to and if the user does not input a specified path, the computer should not
change the directory.
