I'm having trouble getting my ArrayExamples class to pass a test care I wrote. I'm not too sure if my test case is wrong or my averageWithoutLowest function is wrong, but I'm leaning towards my function. When passing the double array {1, 1, 5, 6, 7}, I expect the average to be 6.0 as 1 is the minimum value of the array and should be excluded but my actual value is 9.0. This number doesn't make sense as I create a new variable to account for the number of times lowest appears and remove it from the average calculation. Thank you for your help.
