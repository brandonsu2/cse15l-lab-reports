I'm having trouble getting my ArrayExamples class to pass a test care I wrote. I'm not too sure if my test case is wrong or my averageWithoutLowest function is wrong, but I'm leaning towards my function. When passing the double array {1, 1, 5, 6, 7}, I expect the average to be 6 as 1 is the minimum value of the array and should be excluded but my actual value is 4.5. This number doesn't make sense as it is less than all other values other than 1. Thank you for the help.
